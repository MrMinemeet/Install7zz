# Description
Script to install the official 7-Zip command line tool on Linux.
The script is able to automatically download the latest version for the architecture of your system and install it.

# How to install?
Clone and then run the script as root, it should do the downloading, unpacking and installing for you

**Don't know how to run a script?**  
Wellâ€¦ first make sure it can be executed like this:
`sudo chmod +x ./install.sh`
after this start the script as root:
`sudo ./install.sh`

**Can't you do that for me?**   
Well with this command it's basically copy and paste  
`sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrMinemeet/Install7zz/main/install.sh | sudo bash`

# Now how can I use it?
It's pretty similar to `7z` from the p7zip package, but instead you have to use `7zz` for the official one that you just installed
